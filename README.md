<h1>Password Manager</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Cool project I created using the cryptography library in python. I orignially followed a tutorial from a youtuber named TechWithTim but I later redid the entire thing from scratch all on my own. This is a simple script that lets you input your username and password for a website so that you can save it for later<br />
<br />
<b>This is my password manager:</b><br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-all passwords are inside of an encrypted file<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-only the person with the access code can access the files<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-a user can save as many usernames and passwords as they would like<br /><br />
  &emsp;&emsp;-it uses the terminal as its GUI but I added a little logo of my made up company "goof" at the top to make it look slightly more professional<br /><br />

<br />
I made this all by myself! (However I made a previous version folowing a TechWithTim tutorial on Youtube)<br />
